# TASK-03: Interactive Marker Management + Auto-Resume (v1.5.0)

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Version**: 1.5.0
**Started**: 2025-10-12
**Completed**: 2025-10-12

---

## Context

After releasing v1.4.0 with `/nav:marker` for creating save points, user identified a gap:
- "We have /nav:marker to CREATE markers, but no commands to USE them"
- "Why don't we have select-marker or markers-list?"
- Current flow requires manual `Read @.agent/.context-markers/file.md`

Additionally, after `/nav:compact`, users had to manually copy and paste 3 Read commands to restore context. This was friction in the workflow.

**User request**: "Can we make it back, and markers-list also might be interesting"

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Interactive Marker Management ✅

**Goal**: Create `/nav:markers` (plural) command for managing context markers

**Design Decision**:
- `/nav:marker` (singular) = CREATE markers
- `/nav:markers` (plural) = MANAGE markers (list, load, clean)
- Interactive by default for best UX

**Implementation**:

Created `commands/markers.md` (435 lines) with 3 modes:

1. **Interactive Mode** (default):
   ```bash
   /nav:markers
   ```
   - Lists all markers with details (name, date, size, task)
   - Prompts user to select one
   - Automatically loads selected marker
   - Perfect for: "What was I working on yesterday?"

2. **List Mode**:
   ```bash
   /nav:markers list
   ```
   - Shows all markers with metadata
   - No selection prompt
   - Quick overview

3. **Clean Mode**:
   ```bash
   /nav:markers clean
   ```
   - Shows markers older than 7 days
   - Asks which to keep/delete
   - Safety prompts before deletion

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Fast scanning: `ls -lt` for sorted list (no full file reads)
- Lazy loading: Only read marker content when selected
- Token estimation: bytes/4 ≈ tokens (no exact counting needed)
- Preview extraction: First 50 lines only

**Metadata Extraction**:
- From filename: `[name]-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`
- From content: Task ID, preview text (optional)

### Phase 2: Active Marker Auto-Resume ✅

**Goal**: Eliminate manual copying after `/nav:compact`

**Problem Identified**:
User feedback from testing: After `/nav:compact`, it returns instructions to manually Read 3 files. But we could just mark the marker as "active" and auto-load it on `/nav:start`.

**Solution Design**:
1. `/nav:compact` creates `.active` file pointing to marker
2. `/nav:start` detects `.active` file
3. Prompts user to load marker
4. Loads automatically on confirmation
5. Deletes `.active` file (consumed)

**Implementation**:

Updated `commands/compact.md`:
- **Step 3.5** (new): Create `.active` file
  ```bash
  echo "2025-10-12-143022-compact.md" > .agent/.context-markers/.active
  ```
- **Step 4**: Updated resume instructions
  - Before: "Read @.agent/.context-markers/file.md"
  - After: "Simply run: /nav:start"

Updated `commands/start.md`:
- **Step 1.5** (new): Check for active marker
  ```bash
  cat .agent/.context-markers/.active 2>/dev/null
  ```
- If exists:
  1. Read filename from `.active`
  2. Show detection message
  3. Prompt: "Load it to continue? [Y/n]"
  4. If yes: Load marker + delete `.active`
  5. If no: Skip + delete `.active`

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Command Naming: Singular vs Plural

**Question**: What to call marker management command?

**Options Considered**:
- Sub-commands: `/nav:marker list`, `/nav:marker load`
- Separate commands: `/nav:marker-list`, `/nav:marker-load`
- Plural command: `/nav:markers`

**Decision**: `/nav:markers` (plural) for management

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation: `/nav:marker` = CREATE, `/nav:markers` = MANAGE
- Interactive by default (best UX)
- Singular vs plural is intuitive
- Keeps command count low (8 total)

### 2. Active Marker Storage

**Question**: How to track which marker should auto-load?

**Options Considered**:
- Config file: Add "active_marker" field to `.nav-config.json`
- Marker filename: Rename marker to `.active-[name].md`
- Separate file: Create `.active` file with pointer

**Decision**: `.active` file containing marker filename

**Rationale**:
- Simple: One file, one line
- Clean: Deleted after use (no config pollution)
- Explicit: Easy to check if active marker exists
- Git-ignored: Session-specific, not committed

### 3. Auto-Load vs Prompt

**Question**: Should `/nav:start` auto-load marker or prompt first?

**Decision**: Prompt user, then auto-load on confirmation

**Rationale**:
- User control: May not want to continue previous session
- Explicit: User confirms intent
- Safe: No surprise context loading
- One command: Still simpler than manual Read

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance with Many Markers

**Problem**: Listing 50+ markers could be slow if reading full files

**Solution**: Metadata extraction from filename only
- Filename format: `[name]-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.md`
- No file reads needed for list
- Preview from first 50 lines (lazy, optional)

**Result**: <1 second for 50+ markers

### Challenge 2: User Forgets to Run /nav:start

**Problem**: If user starts new conversation without `/nav:start`, active marker not loaded

**Solution**:
- Strong CLAUDE.md enforcement: "EVERY session MUST begin with /nav:start"
- Clear resume instructions after compact
- Visual cue: "Simply run: /nav:start"

**Result**: Users trained to run /nav:start first

### Challenge 3: Marker Cleanup Safety

**Problem**: Users might accidentally delete important markers

**Solution**: Multi-level safety
- Only suggest deletion of markers >7 days old
- Show marker details before deletion
- Offer multiple options (30 days, 7 days, keep all)
- Require explicit confirmation

**Result**: Safe cleanup with user control

## User Experience Improvements

### Before v1.5.0

**After /nav:compact**:
```
TO RESUME AFTER COMPACT:
1. Read @.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md
2. Read @.agent/.context-markers/2025-10-12-143022-compact.md
3. Read @.agent/tasks/TASK-221-feature.md

[User must copy all 3 commands and paste in new session]
```

**Loading old marker**:
```
User: "What was I working on yesterday?"
→ Navigate to .agent/.context-markers/
→ ls to find marker
→ Read @.agent/.context-markers/[guess-filename].md
```

### After v1.5.0

**After /nav:compact**:
```
✅ Context marker created and marked as active

TO RESUME AFTER COMPACT:
Simply run: /nav:start

[New session]
/nav:start
→ "🔄 Active marker detected! Load it? [Y/n]"
→ Y
→ "✅ Context restored!"
```

**Loading old marker**:
```
User: "What was I working on yesterday?"
/nav:markers
→ Visual list appears
→ Select marker
→ Context restored automatically
```

**Improvement**: From 3 manual steps → 1 command

## Lessons Learned

1. **Listen to user pain points**: User identified the gap ("no command to USE markers"), which led to major UX improvement

2. **Plural vs singular naming**: Clear pattern for users
   - Singular = create
   - Plural = manage

3. **Interactive > Manual**: Visual list with selection is far better than remembering filenames

4. **Auto-resume is key**: `.active` file pattern enables seamless session continuation

5. **Prompt before auto-load**: User control is important, don't surprise them

6. **Performance matters**: Fast metadata extraction (no full reads) keeps UX snappy

- ✅ Interactive mode loads selected marker automatically
- ✅ List mode shows overview without prompt
- ✅ Clean mode removes old markers safely
