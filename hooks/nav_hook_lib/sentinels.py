"""
Navigator hook-runtime sentinels — tag registry, strip primitive, stderr emitter.

This module is the ONLY place under hooks/ allowed to write to stderr, and the
only owner of sentinel-tag knowledge. Two mem-034 rules become structure here:

  1. No op scans unstripped text: callers run ``strip_all()`` over any prompt /
     transcript text before phrase matching, so echoed block notices cannot
     recursively re-trigger a blocker.
  2. Stderr never leaks trigger phrases: ``emit_stderr()`` is the sole stderr
     writer and redacts every phrase in its ``redact`` list before writing.

Residual risk (mem-053): on UserPromptSubmit block messages Claude Code
appends ``Original prompt: <trigger>`` OUTSIDE any sentinel wrap, so tag
stripping alone cannot keep the trigger phrase out of scanned text.
``strip_all()`` therefore also removes ``Original prompt:`` lines — but ONLY
when at least one sentinel was actually removed from the text, so ordinary
user text is never touched. The rule for every gate: match on strip_all()'d
text AND redact triggers on emit (both halves are required; neither alone
closes the recursion loop).

Pure stdlib. See .agent/knowledge/memories/pitfalls/mem-034.md and mem-053.

# Tag registry — enumerated from the v6 sources (sweep 2026-07-10, TASK-59).
#
# kind "block":  paired tags wrapping a whole block notice; Claude Code echoes
#                blocked stderr into the next prompt's context, so strip_all()
#                excises the entire open..close span (content included).
# kind "marker": standalone idempotence marker line (no close tag, no wrapped
#                span); strip_all() removes only the marker string itself and
#                leaves surrounding content intact.
#
# status "current": emitted by a live v6 hook today.
# status "legacy":  no longer emitted, but may persist in old transcripts and
#                   markers — strip_all() must keep removing these forever.
#                   The v6 sweep (hooks/*.py, skills/*/functions/*.py, plus
#                   git-history pickaxe over retired hooks) found no retired
#                   tags, so the legacy shelf ships empty; new entries land
#                   here when a tag is renamed or retired, never deleted.
