## Navigator

**Navigator runtime**: workflow enforcement (session context, workflow gating, read
guarding, intent briefs, completion gating, compact markers) lives in the hook runtime,
not in prose in this file. Off-switches live in `.agent/.nav-config.json`: every hook
block has `enabled` (e.g. `workflow_enforcer_hook.enabled: false`), gating blocks also
take `strict_block: false` to warn instead of block, Tier-1 instant answers toggle per
rule under `tier1.rules` (feature-wide: `tier1.enabled`), and forced continuation stays
off unless `stop_completion.continue_enabled: true`. Setting the `PILOT_EXECUTOR`
environment variable disables interactive/blocking hook behavior for non-interactive
executors. Project docs live in `.agent/` — start from `.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md`
and load task/system/SOP docs on demand, not upfront.
