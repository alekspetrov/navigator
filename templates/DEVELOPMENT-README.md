**When to create**: After solving non-obvious bug or recurring issue

**Example SOPs**:
- Framework-specific errors
- Build/deployment failures
- Common runtime issues

#### Development (`sops/development/`)
**When to create**: Establishing development patterns and workflows

**Example SOPs**:
- Local development setup
- Testing standards
- Git workflow
- Code review checklist

#### Deployment (`sops/deployment/`)
**When to create**: After setting up deployment processes

**Example SOPs**:
- Production deploy checklist
- Rollback procedure
- Environment variable management

**SOP Template**:
```markdown
# SOP: [Process Name]

## Context
[When/why you need this]

## Problem
[What went wrong or needs to be done]

## Solution
### Step-by-step
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

### Code Example
\`\`\`
// Example implementation

## 🔄 When to Read What

### Scenario: Starting New Feature

**Read order**:
1. Ticket via project management → Get requirements
2. Check `tasks/` for similar previous work
3. Review `system/project-architecture.md` → Understand where this fits
4. Review `system/tech-stack-patterns.md` → Patterns needed
5. Check `sops/integrations/` → Any relevant integration guides
6. Generate implementation plan → `/nav:update-doc feature TASK-XX`

**Load into context**: Only relevant docs, not entire .agent/

### Scenario: Adding Third-Party Integration

**Read order**:
1. Check `sops/integrations/` → Similar integration exists?
2. `system/project-architecture.md` → Where integration fits
3. Implement integration
4. Create new SOP → `/nav:update-doc sop integrations [service-name]`
5. Update `system/project-architecture.md` if architecture changed

### Scenario: Debugging Issue

**Read order**:
1. Check `sops/debugging/` → Known issue?
2. Review relevant system doc for context
3. Check project management for related tickets
4. Solve issue
5. If novel pattern → Create SOP: `/nav:update-doc sop debugging [issue-name]`

### Scenario: Context Optimization (Running Low on Tokens)

**Do this**:
1. Read ONLY `DEVELOPMENT-README.md` (this file) → ~2,000 tokens
2. Load ONLY current feature's task doc → ~3,000 tokens
3. Load ONLY needed system doc → ~5,000 tokens
4. Reference SOPs on-demand → ~2,000 each

**Total**: ~12,000 tokens vs ~150,000 if loading everything

**After isolated tasks**: Run `/compact` to clear conversation history

## 🛠️ Slash Commands Reference

### `/nav:update-doc` Command

**Purpose**: Maintain documentation system

**Modes**:

#### 1. Initialize Structure
```bash
/nav:update-doc init
```
Creates folders, generates initial system docs, sets up README

#### 2. Archive Feature Implementation
```bash
/nav:update-doc feature TASK-XX
```
After completing feature, archives implementation plan and updates system docs

#### 3. Create SOP
```bash
/nav:update-doc sop <category> <name>

# Examples:
/nav:update-doc sop integrations stripe
/nav:update-doc sop debugging build-errors
/nav:update-doc sop development local-setup
```

#### 4. Update System Doc
```bash
/nav:update-doc system <doc-name>

# Examples:
/nav:update-doc system architecture
/nav:update-doc system patterns
```

## 📊 Token Optimization Strategy

### On-Demand Documentation Loading

**Instead of loading everything** (~150,000 tokens):

1. **Always load**: `DEVELOPMENT-README.md` (~2,000 tokens)
2. **Load for current work**: Specific task doc (~3,000 tokens)
3. **Load as needed**: Relevant system doc (~5,000 tokens)
4. **Load if required**: Specific SOP (~2,000 tokens)

**Total**: ~12,000 tokens vs ~150,000 (92% savings)

### When to Run `/compact`

**Run after**:
- Completing isolated sub-task
- Finishing documentation update
- Creating SOP
- Research phase before implementation
- Resolving blocker (separate from main work)

**Don't run when**:
- In middle of feature implementation
- Context needed for next sub-task
- Debugging complex issue
